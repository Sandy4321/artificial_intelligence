## AI and machine learning tweets

Install and authenticate with `rwteet`  following the instructions [here](https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet)

Create a starter set searching on the #AI hashtag to identify other hashtags.

```{r}
library(rtweet)
AI <- search_tweets(
  "#AI", n = 10000, include_rts = FALSE
)
```

What hashtags are people using in association with AI in the starter set?

```{r}
library(tidytext)
library(tidyverse)
# unnest the hashtags (one per row)

ai_hashtags <- AI %>%
  unnest(hashtags)

# count up the hashtags
ai_hashtags %>%
  count(hashtags, sort = TRUE)
```


```{r}
# write files
#write_csv(AI, "AI.csv") # has a list column and therefore won't write directly

ai_hashtags %>%
  count(hashtags, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  write_csv(., "ai_hashtags.csv")
```
